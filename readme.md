# manager_readme
This readme is designed to clearly outline my management style and expectations, fostering an open and effective working relationship that empowers my direct reports

*disclaimer: If I want to build trust, I do that by showing up, talking to my team both individually and as a team, and behaving in an ethical, reliable manner. Over, and over, and over again. I don’t get it from writing a doc about how I deserve your trust.*

### My role
TL;DR: I am here to make sure our team is successful, engaged, and working on the things that are most important to help our customers, improve our products & our business. 

- I maintain sustainable team delivery with high-quality and high-impact outcomes
- I build skills of all team members, cross-training to avoid any knowledge-silos 
- I am seen as an expert in Product Security, internally and externally to [$Company]
- I have strong opinions, weakly held. I really like to question things, understand, and see an issue from all sides
- I extend my personal leadership culture of positive & effective collaboration beyond my immediate team
- I am accountable for the decisions the team make, even if I’m not the one making them most of the time (see the balancing of independence & coaching for more context)

How do I measure my success?
- Customer satisfaction and value provided
- Internal team voice survey (specifically related to results for direct manager/leader)
- Feedback from peers
- The contribution of my teams towards [$Company] security objectives
- Systems are reliable/observable, we use observable data to resolve incidents and recovery
- When my team members do something unexpected and amazing for the benefit of others
- Am I achieving my own personal goals and objectives for the year

### My management style

- **Our relationship is a partnership:** Your relationship with me as a manager is a mutually beneficial for both of us. Our goal is to add value to each other, and we help each other be successful. 
- **Balance independence and coaching:** Your success relies on your independence and autonomy. You are capable of working with others and figuring things out - I'm here for guidance, coaching, and to help you as needed. 
  - I layer in expectations at different levels and where you are in your career as a lens here, for example new team members may be paired for onboarding or deliberately for new work. If you find that you need a bit more help, let me know - intentionally pairing and learning alongside the team will help boost your skills and relationships. I will encourage independence early, I find that the [situational leadership theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situational_leadership_theory) is useful for understanding level of guidance needed. 
  -  If you have questions - or need advice - or just someone to bounce an idea off of, I'm always available. 
  -  I will step in and apply additional guidance from time to time. It doesn't mean you've made a mistake or you're doing something wrong - it just means that I spotted an opportunity where I think I can help you.
- **Feedback is critical - for everyone:** I will give you frequent feedback on your work and your impact. When applicable, I will try to give feedback immediately, but it may wait until our 1:1 status. I will NOT wait until a performance review conversation to give you feedback that you have not heard before.
  - I will reach out and ask you to reflect on your own performance (for example after a presentation asking one thing you did well, and one thing you could improve) to foster self-reflection skills and then layer in my additional thoughts.
  - I will share positive constructive feedback as well, especially if you are exemplifying company behaviors or exceeding on delivery. 
  - I welcome your feedback too. I will make mistakes - but I want to learn and improve. 
  - If you're not comfortable giving me some feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to someone above me in the management chain so they can anonymously relay it to me.
  - Similarly, if you have feedback for a team member, I encourage you to give it to them directly; if you're not comfortable doing so, let's chat and I can either get the feedback to them or we can figure out a way to deliver it that makes you comfortable.
- **Empowerment:** I care that everyone has the ability to make decisions, prioritize work, and share their opinions. 
  - I find the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix) (urgency/significance) very useful. Be aware that not everything you’re asked to do Urgently is actually Significant; and that there is Significant non-Urgent stuff which nobody is bugging you for. Prioritize accordingly.
  - I also find the [Impact/Effort matrix](https://miro.com/templates/impact-effort-matrix/) useful, and that you have to be thoughtufl as to where you’re spending your effort. Resist the lure of low-effort but low-impact work.
- **Action-Oriented:** I tend to want to move quicker and adjust/learn along the way, very little that we do requires a perfect plan to be fully determined prior to starting. However, when we do begin work I prefer re-using components/processes where possible with new technologies or solutions implemented with intentionality. 
- **Fun:** I strongly believe that if you can have fun with your team you can do anything together, include the type of work that everyone hates to do. It de-escalates critical moments, and provides space for folks to participate more openly. I generally tend to add/bring joy for myself which appears to influence the team. It's important that the humor is always inclusive and is SFW (safe for work). I will prioritize team connection moments with time for team fun, ideally this isn't forced fun and actually caters to a majority of what the group is interested in doing. 


### 1:1s & Dev Statuses

##### 1:1s
- You should expect to have a 1:1 with me every two weeks if you report directly to me.
- 1:1s are your time for feedback, guidance, context, venting, or anything you want to discuss.

##### Dev Statuses
- You should expect to have a dev statuses with me quarterly if you report directly to me.
  - Based on our joint discussions we will thoughtfully pair on key deliverables throughout the year using your interests, areas that you want to build skills, and team-need for cross-training. I will make sure that you are prepared for this work assigned, or we will purposefully build in learning time as needed so you can successfully accomplish the tasks.  
- I focus on finding opportunities for the people on my team. To that end, I try to stay on top of people's interests and career goals (and will refer back to your G&Os), to find projects and roles that will further those goals and interests. I am generally willing to take a slight hit on speed of delivery for a project if it means that we can grow as a team by sharing knowledge more.
- I will provide you with outside perspective. You may know where you want to be, but when you’re living it in the moment it can be hard to see if there’s a gap and where. I will partner with you to line up the opportunities needed for the growth you are targeting. 
- If you have career conversations, don't wait for a dev status - bring items up in our regular 1:1s.

### How to reach me / communication preferences

I prioritize the following ways if you need to reach me:
- Slack: direct messages, channels
- In person
- Email 
- My personal cell (text) — please use this only in emergencies (my DRs and Jen have this number)

Frequent, high-quality communication is essential to our work. Err on the side of over-communication (dial it up to 11!) and I will help you adapt downward from there. 

I much prefer using group distribution mechanisms (e.g., public Slack channels, JIRA ticket comments, GitHub PRs) as much as possible over direct conversations (e.g., long cc lists, Slack direct messages). This is not to say that you shouldn’t turn to your neighbor and have an in-person conversation; definitely do that! But record context in forums that are visible not just to you and your neighbor.

I’m big on work/life balance. You’ll generally find me in the office between 08:00 and 16:00 and unless there’s an emergency, I don’t expect to communicate with you outside of these hours with respect to your local time. I try not to respond to e-mails or Slack during off-hours and under no circumstances expect you to, unless it’s an emergency.

I bias toward transparency and candor.  You can ask anything. Most of the time, I'll answer.  Rarely, I won't. I'm committed to never lying to you.

### Calendar

My calendar is public, and very few events are private. It is up to date with my meetings/availability/time off/etc. 

It is not your responsibility to manage my time. My time is my responsibility to manage. (I believe the converse as well: it is your responsibility to manage your time!)

If you need something, please ask and if necessary schedule a meeting. Anything that is tentative on my calendar can be booked over (this is generally my own personal blocks of work planning.)

Please avoid blocking time on Friday afternoon without asking. 

### Ownership of work, meetings, and your career

My goal is for the team to not depend on me for day-to-day items (may change depending on where the team is with balancing independence/coaching - see [my management style](#my-management-style) for more context.) I’ll support as needed, but generally any seniors/leads on the team are already responsible and running this work. 

What do I expect from our meetings together (1:1, dev statuses, additional time setup):
- You should come prepared with things you want to discuss. I may occasionally have things to cover as well, but your topics are the priority.
- For development conversations, I expect you to come prepared with your updated G&O document that we started the year with to review how it's progressing and any changes.
- At the end of the day, it’s your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. You determine whether you make the time to get there..

What do I expect when you lead delivery:
- **Intentional design** (frontend+backend). We have added to working agreements that any items designed are reviewed by the working group/team. We want to reduce rework and follow team patterns.   
- **Ask questions.** Don’t take anything for granted. Challenge the assumptions, and aim to understand WHY we are doing this work. I’ll back you up. 
- **Break down the work.** Provide the right level of info, assume you won’t be the one implementing the jira tickets.
- **Suggest the best way to divide the work,** and take full ownership. Work with the other team members on this, make sure they understand it.
- **Gather feedback on your work.** Ask me, other team members. Be specific, and aim to know where you could improve.

The ability to share and collaborate is an indicator of a strong team. All of us are here to help drive work forward to inspire joy in the everyday life for Target guests. We cannot get there if we are not willing to share ideas and collaborate as much as possible.
- I expect you to share lots, especially with your immediate team.
- I expect you to share the decision making, or intentially seek feedback prior to making a decision and be honestly open to other ideas. 
- I expect you to seek feedback regarding your work.
- I expect you to help others with a problem.
- All of the above is not about over-sharing and collaborating on mundane/trivial things.

### Personal & Team Brand Goals

Personal Brand: Get Stuff Done with time for fun
- Approachable
- Organized & Activating
- Learning-focused
- Bringing Joy

Team Brand: [$Company] leadership group discussed team culture and characteristics of the culture we want to have for this team. 
- Credible
- Psychologically Safe
- Good Partners
- Intentional

If I describe my ideal for our team and each person on it, it is that we:
- take control of, and responsibility for, our own objectives
- have each other’s back
- hold each other accountable
- expect high-quality output in ourselves and each other
- assume positive intent
- always question, always ask “why?”
- constantly learn
- laugh together


### Personality Quirks

- :fire: [Fire red energy](https://www.fullcircletd.co.uk/insight-discovery/colour-energies/): I can be quick to respond, and sometimes that isn't empowering or gives enough space for the team to address items themselves, tell me!
- I am an introvert: I will prefer going deep into conversation topics over small-talk, sometimes I jump to the meat before the appetizer - pull me back to the surface if you think this will help in a conversation. 
- I am very food motivated: food analogies are common.
- I can quickly pick up on body language and unsaid emotions: I might check in on items with folks personally, please let me know if there are outside factors impacting how you show up in/around the team.
